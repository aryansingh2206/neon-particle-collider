## ✨ Features  
✅ **Realistic Particle Motion** – Smooth animations with physics-based movement  
✅ **Mouse Interaction** – Particles follow the cursor dynamically  
✅ **Neon Glow Effect** – Vibrant, colorful particles with a futuristic look  
✅ **Randomized Particle Behavior** – Unique movement patterns each time  
✅ **Responsive Design** – Works on both desktop and mobile  

## 🎮 How It Works  
1. **Particles spawn** dynamically and move in random directions.  
2. **Mouse Interaction** – Move your cursor, and particles will be attracted to it.  
3. **Collisions & Interactions** – Particles react when they come close to each other.  
4. **Colorful Neon Effect** – Particles glow and blend into the background for a visually stunning effect.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5 Canvas** – Drawing and rendering particles  
- **JavaScript** – Particle physics and animation logic  
- **CSS3** – Styling and background effects  
 

## 🏗️ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/particle-collider.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- 🌌 **More complex physics** – Implement gravitational pull and repulsion  
- 🎨 **Custom themes** – Users can select different color palettes  
- 🚀 **Performance Optimization** – Support for thousands of particles
